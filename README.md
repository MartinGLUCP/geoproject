**A python package for interactive mapping and more.**

This project aims to familiarize with interactive map libraries to analyze geographical data and have a visual aspect. I thought about this when I saw the video of Dr Qiusheng Wu, on geospatial segmentation with SAM (segmenting anything model) proposed by Meta.

I then saw that he proposed a 25h course on youtube to understand interactive maps with his module [leafmap](https://leafmap.org/) and create his own python module with github and a nice documentation.
